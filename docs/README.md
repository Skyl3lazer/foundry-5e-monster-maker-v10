This is a continuation of the original module by Giffyglyph, with the goal of updating it to Foundry v10 and D&D 2.2.x. Updated by Skyl3lazer.

**THIS MODULE IS NOT YET FULLY WORKING, DO NOT USE IT FOR YOUR LIVE GAMES YET. IT IS IN ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT.**

If you find issues not already listed in [DEV_TODO](https://github.com/Skyl3lazer/giffyglyph-monster-maker-continued/blob/master/docs/DEV_TODO.md) please leave an Issue here or contact me @Skyl3lazer on Discord.

Want to build new monsters for your [Foundry VTT](https://foundryvtt.com/) D&D 5e campaign, but aren't sure how to balance them easily? No worries—**Giffyglyph's 5e Monster Maker** has you covered! Build level-appropriate D&D 5e monsters in _seconds_ with an all-new automated monster sheet and scaling actions.

## Features

* A brand new monster sheet with customisable themes.
* Fully-scaled monster stats for levels -5 to 50.
* 4 monster roles—minion, standard, elite, and paragons.
* 6 combat roles—controller, defender, lurker, skirmisher, striker, and supporter.
* Change the level of any monster on-the-fly and watch their stats change.
* A new scaling action sheet with fully-scaling attacks.
* Easy-to-use shortcodes to make scaling features even easier.
* Convert existing monsters in seconds by simply changing the active sheet.
* Includes full stats from the **[Giffyglyph's Monster Maker PDF](https://giffyglyph.com/#giffyglyphs-monster-maker)**.

## Installation

You can install this Foundry module by copying a manifest URL into your Foundry setup:


* **V3 RC 0.5 (Main Release):** https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Skyl3lazer/giffyglyph-monster-maker-continued/master/module.json	
  * This is probably what you want
* **v3 Dev 0.6 (May be unstable):** https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Skyl3lazer/giffyglyph-monster-maker-continued/dev/module.json
  * For the Brave
* **MM v2 (Legacy):** https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Skyl3lazer/giffyglyph-monster-maker-continued/v2/module.json
  * This is the original GGMM v2 module, only updated for Foundry v10 / dnd5e 2.1+. If you find bugs in it they may not get fixed unless I have a fix from other branches.


You can install multiple branches side-by-side, but you must activate only **one branch at a time**.

## Getting Started

1. Install and activate the module.
2. On the sidebar—under "Actors—you will see **"Create a Scaling Monster"**. Click it.
3. Customise your monster by changing the level, rank, and role. See your monster's stats update live with each change.
4. On the sidebar—under "Items"—you will see **"Create a Scaling Action"**. Click it.
5. Customise your action by adding an attack—try a _"Melee Weapon Attack"_.
6. Now drag the scaling action onto your scaling monster, and watch the action's attack bonus automatically change to match your monster's bonuses.

### Converting an old Monster

1. Open an existing monster—or import one from the SRD compendium.
2. Change the active sheet to **"Giffyglyph's 5e Monster Maker"**.
3. Change the monster's level, rank, and role to suit the expected encounter.

### Converting an old Action

1. Open an existing item—such as a weapon, feature, or piece of loot.
2. Change the active sheet to **"Giffyglyph's 5e Scaling Action"**.
3. Customise the action with some scaling features and shortcodes.
