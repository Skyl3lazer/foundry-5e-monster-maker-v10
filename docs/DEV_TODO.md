# TODO

## Visual

* Should proficiency show still under Attributes?

## Data Entry

* Ability Modifiers should be high/medium/low rather than ranking

## Compendiums

* Many of the entries have not been migrated to v3 

## Modal/Info Updates

* I'm sure there's lots!
* Remove unused localization entries referring to deprecated data
* Rename localization entries based on new uses
* Consolidate duplicate attack_bonus + proficiency modifiers

## Known Bugs

* Converting monsters to Scalers doesn't always work
* Skins don't seem to work
* Had a weird thing where an trait would lose its save target sometimes for unclear reasons
